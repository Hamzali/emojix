I have just tidy up the project for better ergonomics moved things around. Added word and hint information to the game so I can show to the players. Next time I would like introduce to ability to guess the word in order to get points. My plan is to first finisht the basic mechanics of the user before adding any content like list of words, categories and so on. I will first make the game playable and enjoyable before introducing content.

I have learnt about `rm -f` usage for deleting files without error if the file does not exists. Also learnt about go templating extension and picked gohtml introduced a formatter for it and integrated in zed.
